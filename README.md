# Installation

Find the code for this application at my Github page.

# Usage

Use the npm i command to install the needed files. Then, use the node index.js to begin the program. Answer the questions about the manager, then add as many engineers and interns as you need. When you are done, select the "finish" option. This will generate an HTML file with the information you entered.
